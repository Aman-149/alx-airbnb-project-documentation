# 🏠 Airbnb Clone – Documentation Phase

## 📖 Overview
The **Airbnb Clone** is a backend-focused project designed to replicate the key features of the Airbnb platform.  
It provides APIs for user management, property listings, booking reservations, and payment processing.  
This documentation represents the **planning and design phase**, outlining the system’s structure, data flow, and technical requirements before development begins.

- Translate project requirements into a structured list of features.
- Model system interactions using **Use Case Diagrams**.
- Write **User Stories** that define user goals.
- Map data flow with **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**.
- Create **Flowcharts** to represent backend logic.
- Define **technical and functional specifications** for backend features.
- Use **Draw.io** and **Markdown** to produce clear documentation.
